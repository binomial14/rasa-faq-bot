        "a": "This humidistat runs off 24V AC and often has it's own step down power supply when the blower board doesn't support it. Check if you are getting 24V AC coming up to the humidistat. The solenoid for the water should be closed unless the blower motor comes on. The transformer is hooked directly at the blower board for aux power 115V. Check your manual for the diagram. If it's blowing the breaker, the blower board is probably detecting a problem with the step down transformer 115 to 24 AC. I'd be checking there. The humidistat acts like a light switch and that's just a simple circuit, open or closed. When you turn the knob you can hear it click, that's opening and closing the circuit to directly to the water solenoid. If the solenoid is stuck open, the solenoid is probably blown. The people who installed ours (before we bought the house) hooked it up without the 24V AC step down. 115V directly to the solenoid and poof it's gonna blow. When it blows, its stuck open leaving water constantly flowing. Here are two links to products that are comparable to what I referenced. Hope that helps.

        "a": "First of all...what is the problem? Are the valves not turning on and off, or is the water just not flowing to the icemaker. My problem was both. Since the water dispenser was working, I 'tested' the old icemaker valve by disconnecting the water dispenser valve's electrical clip and attached it to the icemaker connection. Then pushing the water dispenser lever on the front of the refrigerator I got no water flow and knew the icemaker valve was faulty. Once I replaced the valves and reconnected the water lines, still no water was going to the icemaker. I disconnected the ice water line and tried to blow air through it. Blow hard as there may be water still in the line. I couldn't get air to pass through. Turned out the water line also was frozen on top of the freezer. I unscrewed and removed the icemaker cover to get access to the black water dispensing tube. Usuing a stiff wire and hair drier for about 15 minutes I was finally able to melt the ice in the water supply tube. Problem also could be the electronic control board. If you need to check if that is the problem, set icemaker to ON and pour about a cup of water into the ice cube tray. You should have a set of ice cubes form and ejected within an hour. As for instructions, there are lots of great how-to-videos on YouTube. I think I used this one... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAYsVrm2IEg",

I loosened the four screws that hold down the glass cover, lifted it up a bit and could easily see the light housings. They are held in only with a clip, and by pushing down they come out easily. (You could probably just pry them out from underneath with a thin knife blade, working carefully so as not to scratch the surface.) The housing is connected with a plug to the 12V DC circuit that powers the LEDS. You can dismantle the housing by removing 4 small (PH-0) Philips head screws. That allows you to see the circular circuit board that holds 9 surface-mounted LEDs. The device is rated 12 Volts DC and less than 2 watts, meaning the current draw is less than 0.167 amps. Someone who knows the current market in LED surface mount devices could probably locate a circular board of similar size that contained some higher lumen output LEDs. (The technology on these is improving rapidly.) Or the manufacturer could get smart and get some themselves and offer us replacement plug-in units. But none of this helps you now. I was surprised how bright the 9 little bulbs were, and first thought maybe the diffuser was the problem in diminishing light output. But when I held the circuit board up in position without the diffuser and turned off the kitchen light, I could still see that the output was too slight. Anyway, although it doesn't immediately solve our problem of a low-lumen light, it was fun research. I took pictures, but can't figure out how they might be posted here.",

        "q": "how to use it without getting caught by the owner water usage i want to buy one",
        "a": "It's a small enough machine so you can hide it in your closet when not in use. Not too noisy either. Water usage is about 1.5-2 buckets full of water, plus what you use for rinsing. It's less than what you'd use filling up your bathtub for a bath... When I use this, I use the method we used to use when I was a child and haven't had an automated washer. This method will save you water, too. : Fill the washer part with water. Warmer water should be used for whites. Fill up a bucket or a children size tub with colder water for rinsing. Separate your laundry by colours, and start the wash with whites. When the whites are done, twist them over the washer, so the water will stay in the washer, then put the laundry into the bucket filled for rinsing. Then put the next, darker coloured bunch of laundry into the same water in the washer. Wash it, and during that rinse you whites in the bucket, then twist or squeeze them before placing them in the spining part of the machine. Once spinned, shake the items to reduce wrinkles, then hang them on a drying rack or wire or hanger to dry. Same to do with the darker colours. As you get ahead with the process, the water temperature will be reduced as well by time. You'll save water, gas or electricity to heat the water and probably time as well. As said earlier, for one wash for all or most colours you use less water than using by having a bath or a long shower. Obviously if it is more than one person's laundry, you might need a bit more water and time, but the amount of water used will be still less than having a bath each. I hope this helps. And one more thing. Sometimes landlords don't want washers installed in apartments, because of lack of space or because they are afraid of leakage. I can assure you that you can spill more water by handwashing your stuff at home in the bathroom than by using this washer carefully, not to mention that those landlords would not think of such options as this portable washer. I'd might go to my landlord and ask for permission, rather than hiding it and doing laundry secretly. But all circumstances differ as all people are different.",

My favorite shutoff feature is the timer which lets you decide exactly how long the heating element should be on and will shut it off when the time expires.

I bought the suction cup to unscrew the bulb a long time back - Almost any hardware store should have something similar - a cup holder with suction cup sounds about the right size.

On the other hand, you really should never load up a disposer like this and should not discard larger solids through the disposer anyway.

Therefore, it will not fit your machine hook ups or plug in parts, thus creating a leak or bad electrical connection. To be sure what part # is correct check the part number and match to the part number you are replacing. If there are no numbers on part you want to replace, look at the specific model and make of your machine and match that way. Each manufacturer has specific # on their parts for each model of machine they sell. Descriptions also in listing with part stating what machine or model they go with. Numbers could also be engraved on original part too. If you still aren't 100% sure it's the correct part for your machine, call the 800# for the manufacturer of your machine. They can generally give you help with part numbers. In closing, if you do order the wrong part, Amazon is very good about returns and replacements.

I contacted the vendor and he offered to accept the filters in return and refund the purchase. Since he seemed willing to stand behind his product, I kept the filters. About 5 weeks later I needed to replace the filter. When I installed the new one and tried to flush water through it I discovered the same phenomenon that you describing: I believe what both you and I saw is activated charcoal which being released. I would return the filter immediately. I was impressed with the integrity of the vendor that sold me the defective filters (I think the company name was something like Tune to Music). I emailed them immediately after installing the defective filter. He responded immediately by crediting my charge card and saying I did not need to return the filters. He explained that they were purchased from a supplier that for other reasons he was no longer affiliated with. I assumed that he got burned with defective merchandise from that vendor but made good on our transaction! In the past these filters had been in stock at Amazon and I never had a problem with them.

Problem is the bucket the ice goes in is small, and once it's full it stops making ice until you empty it. So, if you stood there and babysat it, emptying the ice into your ice bin every 20 minutes or so, you could fill a large bin in less than 2 hours. The ice that comes out is only 32 degrees (and melting), and the ice bin in your refrigerator is usually around zero degrees so the ice will stick together as it cools down.

After removing the worst of it, you could then carefully (IF the screen is metal and there is no RUBBER gasket), hold the screen over a flame to burn off the rest.

In the instructions it said something like - if you prefer not to vent the dryer through a window, you may just enjoy the 'pleasant warming' it will provide to your room. Must be cold year round in China, huh? I didn't mind a little 'warming' in Jan-Feb. But it's in the 90's now in NYC. Don't think I'd want to run it unvented in a windowless room today.

When I received them I noticed a few aspects that were different. The caps were red not blue; the filters were shrink wrapped rather than the usual cardboard container and; there were product information sheets enclosed. I contacted the vendor and he offered to accept the filters in return and refund the purchase. Since he seemed willing to stand behind his product, I kept the filters. About 5 weeks later I needed to replace the filter. When I installed the new one and tried to flush water through it I discovered the same phenomenon that you describing: I believe what both you and I saw is activated charcoal which being released. I would return the filter immediately. I was impressed with the integrity of the vendor that sold me the defective filters (I think the company name was something like Tune to Music). I emailed them immediately after installing the defective filter. He responded immediately by crediting my charge card and saying I did not need to return the filters. He explained that they were purchased from a supplier that for other reasons he was no longer affiliated with. I assumed that he got burned with defective merchandise from that vendor but made good on our transaction! In the past these filters had been in stock at Amazon and I never had a problem with them. When I replaced the defective filters, I again ordered from Amazon and the vendor actually filling the order was AtoZSales. The filters were LG OEM and exactly what I expected!",

It would of course be wise to go on-line to Danby and check with them. The Danby countertop Washers are great when you don't have the room for a full sized Washer.

The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is constructed so well that there seems to be no reason why it would not do perfectly well in a garage. If I had a garage, I would put the Danby Freezer in it too. Also, the Freezer is Silent when it is on! It makes a very low noise after you open the door and close it, that it sounds like it is making it airtight. The Danby Freezer has heavy duty plastic sliders that move smoothly when pushing the Freezer on a floor, they also adjust in height if a floor is a little off balanced. I feel the sliders on the Danby Freezer would not move easily on a dry cement floor, unless it was painted to a durable and smooth finish. Therefore, I would protect the floor that you put the freezer on from dry cement, corrosion and dampness. I would set the Danby Freezer on top of a 1/4\" inch thick Plexiglass plastic flooring or something similar. The Danby Freezer is easy to clean and defrosts rather quickly. You can place a small one inch tall long baking pan set on the floor with the door open and any water draining out can be caught in the pan. There are no ice chunks forming inside the Freezer either. It just has a frosty coating or snowy look around the walls and elements inside the Freezer that melt off the interior when it is defrosting. The Danby DUF408WE Freezer is the Best Freezer I ever had! You will not be disappointed. Best regards and Happy Holidays for the New Year! ~ Marc",

Please note the screws go only from one piece of the flange to the other not trespassing the sink bottom.

I have cut the holess much bigger and it's better, but still needs a manual defrost. This last time I made the holes enormous, so lets see if that helps. If I just left it alone, and not manual defrosted, the deice sensor burns out and and that costs $$$. It has already burnt out 2, thats why I have to fiddle with it.

You might have to jerry-rig some of the connections, but the kit comes with threaded connections and washers, so no PVC glue or primer is necessary. Just make sure you measure twice, cut once, and install the washers in the correct direction, and you should be able to make it work.

        "a": "If all the filters are original PUR* replacement filters, the filter medium will be the same. Someone has posted that the PBSS filter is inferior to the others, but I see no data to back up that assertion. The difference is in the amount of water they can filter before recommended replacement and the flow rate. The \"universal\" PBSS filter is rated at 100gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396710 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.5GPM flow rate. The 4396841 is rated 200gal. capacity and 0.85GPH flow rate. Strangely, both the 100 & 200 gal. capacity models are recommended for 6 months replacement. You would think the 200gal. models would last longer. Some whirlpool refrigerators offer what's called \"fast-fill\" systems, which dispense the water almost twice as fast as \"normal\" systems. It stands to reason that the 4396841 would be best if you want/need the higher flow rate. It also stands to reason that the lower flow rate models probably filter better since the cartridges (and presumably the filter mediums) are exactly the same size (educated opinion). I have decided on the 4396710 for my refrigerator. I researched a lot for this answer, I hope it helps.",

There is a 10 second delay before it starts. You leave the water on until it beeps several times, telling you it's finished. You turn off dishwasher, turn off water, push the red release button on coupler (releases any water pressure) then you uncouple and then I pull the hose upward from the back to drain water still in hose. Certain cycles heat the water so you'll want to pull open the door and let the steam out and the dishes (hot) will finish drying. The manual is not written well, but it's not rocket science, so you'll figure it out. But you leave hot on until it finishes the cycle (also, the red light that flashes while running, goes solid red when cycle is over). It has a lot of options, so you'll want to read it carefully.

The Moen does have small aluminum flakes in the coating giving it the appearance of gold flakes. The two blend so well I thought the RO tap had gold flakes also. However it doesn't. It appears to have very small particle size mica in the coating. On cars, the mica would give the coating a subtle sparkle versus aluminum which can be small particle size giving the subtle reflectiveness or the in your face large particle aluminum that sparkles not just that little shimmer. Taking into account the sparkle/shimmer effect of mica and aluminum flake it would easily be an industry match since untrained eyes cannot pick up the minute color differences. So I would say it doesn't have a solid chocolate brown appearance and it is not an exact match to my Moen faucet. But unless you get up close with a light to reflect off of the coating, you'd consider it a good match. Aside from that, you cna always return it if the subtle differences bother you.",

There may be accessories to accommodate the curve but you'd have check on electrolux's website. There should be a fitment guide pdf guide there. The main concern is the slide in is designed slide over the counter so its nearly flush with the counter. If you have tile with a round edge on the left and right if the stove you won't be able to get the stove top flat with the counters and it won't look right. Even if you satisfy the flat countertop requirement, you will ideally want a small strip of countertop behind the stove to fill the gap between the backsplash and the back of the stove. Slide in ranges are designed to look like counter top stoves and the trim piece on the stove is designed to be flush with the countertop on 3 sides (left, behind, right). Although I've seen optional accessories for placing a \"dummy\" filler piece behind the stove to fill the gap on back, you'd have to check the website or ask an appliance retailer. With all that being said, I would just buy the Electrolux free standing induction version if that is the stove/counter configuration you have now. It will be a direct replacement.

Stoves are automatic systems that turn the electric current on and off as needed to keep the burner at a desired temperature. They don't adjust the amount of electricity applied to the burner...they turn on the power full-blast or completely off. A sensor monitors the temperature and turns the power on if it is too low or turns it off if it is too high. The radiant cook top is a special kind of element that can get VERY hot VERY fast (much faster than the old kind). The temperature sensor is near the element below the glass and the element gets hotter than the hottest setting quickly and turns of the power even though the pot of food above the glass is still not super hot. So you will see the burner get red then go off several times before your food finishes cooking. This is normal. Even though it seems like it would get hot faster if it just stayed on continuously, that would actually be bad because the element would overheat and burn out. Old style burners do the same thing, but you don't notice it as much because they take longer to cool down and stop glowing red so it seems like they are always on when you set them to high (but they aren't). The same thing that makes them stay red longer, also makes them take longer to get hot so if the new element was made to be a lot slower to heat up, it would seem to stay red and it would work like the old kind (but it would take longer to cook your food).",

We knew something was wrong when there was no water in the original filter when first removed. Apparently, the guys who installed the fridge never fully engaged the filter, and I followed their lead. The filter works perfectly now. We were also cautioned about \"generic\" filters that are knock-off quality and not able to filter as well or as long.

And if you are fairly good at that stuff it should take between 15 and 30 minutes. In any case no previous dishwasher knowledge is necessary. I learned that one thing that wrecks the chopper is paper (usually from paper labels on jars or containers). It gets partially disintegrated from the water and soap and as the paper bits go through the chopper they ball up which get between the blades and push them off the shaft. Good luck.

Another interesting aspect of the picture of a pump is that they managed to hide the attachment points of the two hoses. The inlet hose attaches to the back of the trap chamber on the left foreground of the picture. The trap keeps change and other debris from entering the pump. The pump itself is in the middle of the picture. The outlet extends at a 45 angle and cannot be seen becaust it is directly on the other side of the pump. The tan cap covers the motor and is normally on the right. Other than showing the pump rotated 180, the pump is in the correct orientation in the machine. You can open and empty the trap from the front without removing the pump. Removing the pump is tricky as you have to depress the black rubber padding on the feet in just the right way in order to remove the pump. Search YouTube for videos on how to do this. Be prepared for water! Since the pump is located at the bottom of the machine it cannot pump out all the water. Using a wet-vac to suck water out of the exaust tube gets rid of most of it.",

Use one where you can adjust the depth and only expose enough of the blade to cut the plastic. cut the hold large enough to expose the foam. Using a plastic spoon, stick, your fingers, just nothing sharp, scrape away the foam until you get to the metal outer shell. You may or many not run into cooling lines but if you do, you now have them exposed and you can drill from the INSIDE to run your CO2 lines.

Full on elbow motion only enhances the efficiency on this stain setting. An open leg stance with hip sway AND full back arching are required to attain a vigorous agitation cycle. In either case, this washer's shaft is sturdy, rock hard, smooth and comfortable to grip.

When I am browning a large amount of hamburger in my 2\" deep skillet, I have to move meat from outside to inside where it will brown faster unless I up the temp. It will cook, but not as quickly as inside ring. I guess that is true with most burners, but I do wish Nuwave would make a 12\". Bottom line is the burner really works and is worth purchasing.

        "q": "My well water contains silt that clogs my washing machine. Which filter should I use on the washing machine cold water inlet line?",
        "a": "This requires a multifaceted answer. First of all, how large is the sediment your well draws in? These filters are available in several different screen or mesh filter sizes. If it is sandy, you need to compare the size of the sand to the micron size of the filter element. I'd say this is the most important research that you need to do. Next I'd ask how much sand gets drawn in say daily, then over the course of a week. Thus could be determined by how much sand is in your toilet tanks, (when you take the lid off and look inside); then how often do you clean the screens on the washer? Lastly, do you see sand in the faucet arreaters? If the answer is a great deal to any of the above questions, I would advise you to get a filter which is one pipe size larger then then waterline coming from your pressure pump/ inlet to your house. This will allow a longer time between flushing intervals of the filter. I have used them in this application in the past, with great results for our customers. If it is installed correctly, the drain on the bottom would be run to the outside,or a nearby drain. Be sure to install a union on the drain line to allow for occasional disassembly. When the filter shows signs of being clogged- sediment in the bottom, color in the screen; then you flush it out for 1-2 minutes, until clear. I hope this helps you.

Feel for wetness with your fingers to find out where the water is coming from- if it is above where the hose connects, which in this case it most likely is, the faucet needs to be replaced, or at least new gaskets installed- I'd replace the faucet if that is the case. If that is dry, but is wet only at or below where you've attached the hose to the faucet, then the hose connector is where the leak is occurring. In this case, you probably will only need to replace a 25 cent rubber washer. Dry everything with paper towel or rag before checking where the leak I coming from. Plumbers tape is not an option- your seal is the rubber washer between the hose and the faucet, always check to make sure the rubber washers are in place. Hope this helps...",

You should also hear the compressor kick on after the water has been pumped into the freezing chamber, and if you place your hand next to the the exhaust port you ought to begin feeling slightly warmed air blowing out. Within 10 to 12 minutes your first batch of ice will be done. You hear very audibly when the machine slides the ice off the freezing elements and they tumble onto a temporary holding platform. Then you will hear the ice being raised up on the platform and pushed off of it down into the catch basket. The clattering of the ice is unmistakable.

Around the edge of the pan is not hot enough for max heat. A problem for saute, but not to boil water or slow cook, depends on what you're cooking. I use my 8 inch cast iron fry pan a lot. Our 4 qt capacity enameled cast iron Walmart LeCrueset knock-off works great as such bowl-shaped cookware has a smaller diameter area at the bottom. For serious cooking with a Wok you should use an extra large gas burner. Good quality Tri-clad cookware with the induction symbol stamped on the bottom such as Fagor cookware works very well and is not very expensive. I have a tall 8 1/2\" diameter stockpot that holds 5-6 quarts that I use for soups, stews and slow cooking. The tri-clad bottom spreads the heat evenly, so thick stews don't burn on the low settings. Most six quart stainless steel Pressure cookers work OK, though you should only fill a P.C. 2/3 full. My nephew uses it on his Cabin Cruiser because it doesn't draw too much current.

First fill is with laundry detergent; second fill I add 1 cup vinegar to assist the rinse out of detergent; and the final fill is to rinse out all vinegar/ soap residue. This vinegar technique does cut down on the lint retention on clothing. There is nothing else to capture lint. I would like to know what others do about laundry lint.

You might want to try this trick, if this is the only part you need to replace. This is some type of fuse to keep your dryer from overheating. Take it out and if you can test the leads, if you can. If not the top should be flat and yours may now be more domned. If this is the case throw in on a concrete floor three or four times.

I also presume you know how to get to the part by removing the access panel and some insulation. The part should be on the left side. When you remove the old valve out you need to understand that taking the screws out is not enough to remove it. You need to \"unhook\" (if I can say it) from the frame it is mounted on. Try t wiggle it up and down gently and to the sides and you will be able to detach it from the frame. This way you will be able to bring the valve closer to yourself and you will be able to see and access the electric plug and incoming water hose and out coming water hose. So, unplug the plug that supplies the voltage to the old valve by squeezing the \"locks\" on the plug. The plug unplugs similarly to the telephone line from the phone outlet or network cable. Keep in mind that the plug might be stuck. So, you may want to move it to the sides gently. If it does not come out it may mean that you are not squeezing it right (find that release latch). Then you need to take off the incoming water supply hose and outcoming water hose. One of them can be twisted off using adjustable wrench while the other (thinner one) has a wire based spindle (I hope I call it right), which secures the hose on the valve. Some remaining water will come out. So, it is a good idea to have a towel in that area to capture that water before disconnecting the hoses. Then you do everything in reverse using the new valve. Make sure that the thin hose fits all the way on the new valve and is secured with the wire spindle again. This may require some effort to do it. Also when you put the thick hose back be gentle and do not over tighten the nut of the hose.",

The \"F\" is a waste of your money. Pay a little bit more to protect your health, and stick with the \"G\" model. By-the-way, don't purchase any of the cheap, off-brand filters as they are every one the equivalent of the \"F\" model Samsung Aqua Pure filter.

The Sabbath feature may only be used with the BAKE pad. The oven temperature may be set higher or lower after setting the Sabbath feature (the oven temperature adjustment feature should be used only during Jewish Holidays), however the display will not visibly show or provide any audible tones indicating whether the change occurred correctly. Once the oven is properly set using Bake with the Sabbath feature active, the oven will remain continuously ON until cancelled. This will override the factory preset 12-Hour Energy Saving feature. If the oven light will be needed during the Sabbath, press Oven light pad before activating the Sabbath feature. Once the oven light is turned ON and the Sabbath feature is active, the oven light will remain ON until the Sabbath feature is turned OFF. If the oven light needs to be OFF, be sure to turn the oven light OFF before activating the Sabbath feature. IMPORTANT NOTES: It is not advised to attempt to activate any other program feature other than BAKE while the Sabbath feature is active. ONLY the following key pads will function after setting the Sabbath feature; UP or DOWN ARROW, BAKE, START & CLEAR/OFF pads. ALL OTHER KEYPADS will not function once the Sabbath feature is properly activated. To Program the Oven to Begin Baking Immediately & activate the Sabbath feature 1. Be sure that the clock is set with the correct time of day. 2. Place the food in the oven. 3. Press Bake pad. \"---\" will appear, \"UPPER\" and \"bake \" will flash in the display. 4. Press the Up or Down arrow pad until the desired temperature appears. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" will flash in the display. 5. Press Start pad or wait 5 seconds. \"UPPER\" and \"BAKE\" stop flashing and the icon will appear in the display. 6. If you desire to set the oven control for a Timed Bake or Delayed Start Bake do so at this time. If not, skip this step and continue to step 7. Refer to the Timed Bake (complete steps 6-8) / Delayed Start Bake (complete steps 6-11) section for complete instructions. Remember the oven will shut down after using Timed Bake or Delay Start Bake and therefore may only be used once during the Sabbath/Jewish Holidays. The maximum Delayed Start Bake time is 11 hours & 59 minutes. 7. The oven will turn ON and begin heating.",

        "a": "This is not actually a newer model, but rather a different one. The washer is a bit larger I would say, but in practicality it has the same power. The built in spinner allows for easy transfer of sopping wet clothing without drips on the floor. You can even pull them out of the wash basin while it is still full and throw them right in the spinner to do a rinse and dry. In the end though, if you are thinking about putting down another $150ish bucks when you already have the standalone panda, I would HIGHLY recommend getting the 3,200 RPM spinner with the stainless drum here on Amazon. It is somewhere around that price, but it can hold an entire load from the Panda, and will dry the clothes to almost 100% dry in just a few minutes. This dual unit has a 120 watt 1,300 RPM (The smaller stand alone spinner is actually faster at 1,600 RPM!) spinner that holds less than half of one load from the washing side. The 3,200 RPM one has 400 watts of power and can hold over 11lbs of clothes! Unless the drain pump is super important to you I would skip this one. If I were you I would keep the stand alone Panda and upgrade your dryer! :) Hope this helps!",

        "a": "Hi Marlene, First I should point out this product is not really a filter. It's a wick that absorbs and holds moisture so the blower fan can push air through it and drive the water into the surrounding environment. How often it needs replacing depends upon how often the humidifier cycles and on the mineral content of your water. If you run your humidifier a lot and you are not using filtered water, then these wicks typically need replacing about every three months (at least). I use filtered water in my humidifier to reduce the mineral content but I still have to replace the wick every 5-6 months. It's pretty simple to determine when your wick is clogged with minerals because the humidifier will basically run non-stop as there will be no moisture in the wick therefore no moisture going into the air. These wicks are not really cleanable because they are too fragile. Once they get clogged with minerals (i.e. \"lime\") they need to be disposed of and replaced.",

        "a": "I'm sorry but I do not understand your question. \"Slide ins\" are by nature \"stand alone\" The primary difference from traditional ranges is that they are designed to be placed within a cabinet opening designed to present an integrated appearance. Thus the range top has edges that form a 3/4 inch flange over the counter-top so that cooking spills do not leak down the sides. The counter top opening therefore must conform to the size required by the range (both width and height). Do not confuse \"slide in\" with \"drop in\" Make sure your counter height and width conform to the required spec or that you can alter it to bring it into spec. Ours fit in perfectly and my wife is overjoyed with it. Google \"slide in vs drop in\" in if you are confused over the difference between them. Also make sure that all of your cookware has enough ferrous (iron) material to allow a magnet to stick firmly to the base or the induction range will not work with it. Ours heats a proper saucepan filled with water to a full boil in less then two minutes. Its very responsive. I would not recommend this range to be used without a counter-top at each of its sides. The glass cook-top would have exposed edges that normally lie upon the counter-top and are therefore well protected from possible physical strikes resulting in consequent damage or breakage. Additionally the sides, while painted, are not designed to be exposed to view such as a standard range sitting at the end of a counter with one side exposed to view where a finished surface on the side of the range is desirable.",

Now, elements usually break for the lack of cooling or air flow, so if you put a new element but nobody at home is removing the old lint, the new element is going to burn again. Use your hand and arm and make sure there is no blockage whatsoever inside the duct. Regarding model, before I purchased I went to several sites and found that they are very similar. I thank God, that the guy selling the element in this site, is not running a nuclear power plant, because it would have been smarter to take a picture of the element, than to take a picture of the box, right?

Cast iron, enamel cast iron and most types of stainless steel cookware are all induction compatible (But not all types - for instance, All-Clad's MC2 line, which is made of aluminum and stainless steel, is not induction compatible). Aluminum, copper or glass cookware will not work unless they have a layer on the bottom with magnetic properties. To tell if a pot or pan is induction-compatible, hold a magnet to the bottom. If it clings, the cookware will work on an induction cooktop. Also, many manufacturers have started putting a n \"induction compatible\" symbol on the bottom of their cookware or they'll note compatibility on their packaging. The symbol often looks like a horizontal zig-zag or a coil. If you have an induction cooktop, but a favorite piece of cookware doesn't work on it, don't fret - Mauviel makes a product called the Mauviel Induction Disc (Compare Prices), which can be placed on the cooktop under the pan; the heating reaction will then heat the contents of the pan.

Ms Cowgirl, the Product Description says, \"This amazing instant water heater can be connected to the existing hot water piping.\" So perhaps a better explanation is that YOU cannot hook it up to American piping. If NO ONE could hook it up to American piping, it wouldn't have a 4.4-star rating. Mr Curcie, what difference does it make WHY Ms O'Meara wants it hotter? A shower is not the only way people use hot water. Folks running a food truck, for instance, might need hot water over 100 to make hot tea, instant coffee, wash their utensils, etc. Using the example in the Product Description, tap water coming in at 56 will be heated 45 to 101. This is NOT hot enough for hot drinks, as 101 is only 2.4 above body temperature. Great for baby formula; not great for coffee. If the 101 water from one unit can be run through a second unit, a 45 temperature rise will yield 146 water, which IS hot enough for coffee and hot tea. The biggest problem with Amazon's Q&As is people chiming in with \"answers\" when they don't really know the answer. So how about it? Does anyone (including the seller) actually know the answer to this question?

I usually use the Auto cycle with no option selected. Keep in mind that unless you wait until right before you need your dishes to wash them, the long cycle time isn't really an issue because the machine is so quiet that you can't even tell it's running. I've had mine for three months now and would absolutely buy it again. In three months, I've only had to rewash a dish perhaps twice - and it was a dish with stuck on food. Glasses come out sparkly. And I've found that using liquid Cascade instead of Finish gel packs gets the dishes just as clean (the liquid stuff is less expensive).

I suggest leaving them in the boxes until you get them to the final spot as it makes them easier to move. Installation itself is not all that complicated.

None of them have spin dry, so you will need a separate spinner. The small blue spinner works well. It operates at 1,600 RPM. This is quite a bit faster than a typical washing machines spin cycle. Those are normally about 600 RPM. The larger stainless steel drum spinner operates at 3,200 RPM and leaves your clothes dry enough to wear in a pinch. They will hang dry in only about an hour out of the faster machine. Buy whichever one suits your needs.

The only possible exception is if your bearing needs only grease, which means damage is being done but slowly.

Usually the cause is obvious. If it's not obvious, it's usually the bearing. Try greasing it if nothing else seems to be the problem. Best of luck.",

        "a": "Woder 5K Inline water filter removes 99.99% of contaminants, ie mercury, Chlorine, Contaminants, lead, heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, toxic TTHMs and VOCs. Powerful multi-blends of catalysts remove unwanted and unhealthy mater from your water source without leaking. It is a Class 1 Filter that removes 99.99% of Unwanted Microorganisms, Disinfectants, Disinfection Byproducts, Inorganic Chemicals, Organic Chemicals and Radionuclides. Woder Undersink Water Filter is an Antimicrobial Water Treatment Unit (Granulated carbon with an anti-microbial agent ) of Premium Quality Water Filtration That Exceeds Industry Standards of Both NSF and ANSI. As Mentioned on The Filter Itself, The Inert Ingredient Is 'Clearbrook Gen II Formula'. Being bacteriostatic or maintaining bacteriostasis is important in any filter because it keeps organisms from self forming in filters like the algae and and various parasites similar to what you find in swimming pools once chemicals diminish. The test protocols are not published. The description itself as seen on Amazon makes a summary of the reports. The formula is tested to the EPA Protocol for Microbiological Purifiers by the University of Arizona and by Spectrum Labs in accordance with the relevant ANSI/NSF Protocols. The Woder is manufactured for removal of VOCs and Heavy Metals. It is a granular form filter with integrated diffuser that keeps the water from channeling which is typical of this type filter. In addition, the formula is of the type that is used in industrial applications for removal of high volumes at larger concentrations of contaminants. Obviously...these industrial impacts are not typically found in drinking water so the capacity of the filter is extended",

However, there were no carbon filters installed or included with my purchased unit but I did purchase a pack of 4 which I installed when I set up my unit. I purchased a package of 2 Holmes make HEPA replacement filters (HAPF600D - B Filters) at the same time. Had I researched this better, I would have purchased the same box of 2 filters, plus 1 lone filter (same model #) since the unit requires that all three filter be changed when the red light indicates the filters be replaced. I am not aware of any distinction between an HAPF600 and an HAPF600D filter and I couldn't find this out on the Holmes website, either.

There are two needles. One that automatically follows the changes in atmospheric pressure while the other one remains fixed until moved by hand. 4.

B) Buy another washing machine that is NOT LG. I had to buy a GE about 6 months after I purchased this model BRAND NEW. but FINALLY i have clean clothes!!!! When I was using this NIGHTMARE machine, I would have to set it on \"Bulky bedding\" setting in order to get enough water in the drum to actually get the clothes wet enough to get clean. So yes, you have to set it to \"bulky / bedding\", stand over the machine for however long it takes to fill, then pause it, power off, then power back on and then chose the appropriate wash setting.

I think it happens at the end of the rinse cycle, when the tub is spinning very fast, and water is pouring in for the rinse, and the clothes are getting compressed against the side. Due to this, at some point the clothes are no longer covering the bottom of the washer, and the water pouring in is hitting the empty bottom of the metal tub directly.

        "a": "Sure, I am happy to. There is a popular misconception that there is one Mylar film and the thicker, the better. Actually, there are many kinds of Mylar films which consist of layers of different materials that serve different purposes. Mylar itself is a transparent member of the polyester family that is remarkably strong. The Mylar in this film has a bursting strength of 69 pounds per square inch so it can withstand a lot of abuse. In order to make the film a protective barrier to oxygen, a foil layer is added. (oxygen cannot go through glass or metal) This foil layer can be disturbed by folding, moving or filling the bag and you can sometimes see a scratch or a separation during regular use but these are not holes in the film and do not significantly effect the performance of the bag. Mylar bags from Pack Fresh are made here in Southern California and have never been shipped until you buy them. That is how we can afford to compete with the other discount \"mylar\" that comes from China. There are some enlightening Washington Post articles that should make it clear why American-made products such as those from Pack Fresh are superior.

Also, with no handle sticking out...then no one can walk into the handle or get their clothes caught on it. The Danby has a nice top that is strong and can be used as a shelf if needed. It cleans easily too! The Danby DUF408WE is a wonderful freezer and it is Totally Silent when running! When you open the door it has a suction effect and the motor makes a low hum. After you close the door, you can feel and see the door suction inward as it makes it air tight. The Danby is really the best freezer I have ever owned. The Danby is one of the best decisions I ever made! (Hmmm...of course the Best decision I ever made was when I met my wife and we both knew we were Soul Mates for life!) If you choose this model freezer you will not be disappointed. Hope this review helps you? Best regards ~ Marc",

I love the way I can control the heat of the range and I believe it rivals any gas cook top. I would much prefer the cook top of this range to a gas cook top as the solid surface is easy to maintain, it has warning signals if something boils over and nothing heats up if a pan is not on the surface. I have a very powerful microwave and have done a head to head comparison of bringing water to a boil. This range beats the microwave hands down. In fact, your cooking style will change due to the rapid pace of heating. I love the control I have when making heat sensitive dishes such as gravies, stove top custards and dishes that require high control of heat. The first couple weeks I kept calling my wife over to look at how much better things were cooking up. The ovens are excellent as well. I have not used the lower oven much at all but it would be handy if you are cooking for a large group or need to keep something warm while something else occupies the large oven. Some cool unexpected things regarding this oven is it can be used as a food dryer as well as to proof bread (low heat for yeast breads to rise). The oven has more controls than any mere mortal would ever use. It actually has certain modes for some religious holidays; not making that up. I have seen no downside to the ovens. They are awesome. After three years of use, I truly see no down side to this range at all. I understand that there is a range out there now that will heat a pan no matter where it is placed on the surface.

When the cookware gets hot it will transfer heat to the surface of the PIC. This model has only 5 heat settings. I am completely satisfied. The units on TV are more sophisticated and more expensive. This Nesco is 1500 watts. I have tested this Nesco and it does not proportion the energy at its lower settings (like a microwave in defrost mode). Some do and can cause burning. Some more expensive I have seen are 1800 watts. This Nesco is a practical start to get to know what induction cooking is about. Experiment with what kinds of cookware is right for you.

        "a": "Several possible causes of problems with water to dispenser. Troubleshooting tips: 1. Check to see if the ice maker is still working. If so, the problem is probably not caused by a water filter problem since the water to the ice maker has to go through the filter also. 2. Disconnect water tubing connector at bottom of refrigerator where it enters the freezer door. Then press water dispenser switch. If water comes out of the disconnected line then the problem is probably a frozen water line in the freezer door. Reconnect the line and defrost the freezer. If the problem occurs again there are other measures that can be taken to prevent freezing. 3. Turn off power, remove cover and valve bracket on the back of the unit, and pull the valve assembly out where you can get to it. There are two valves. The first valve is the inlet valve and must open whenever the ice maker or the water dispenser operates. The second valve has two separate outlets - one for the ice maker and one for the freezer. There is a short tubing from the outlet of the first valve to the inlet of the second valve. Disconnect this tubing by pressing in on the connector while pulling out on the tube. Direct the open end of the tube toward a pan. Then keeping clear of all electrical wires, plug the refrigerator back in. Press the water dispenser. If water does not come out of the inlet valve, the valve is probably bad. If it does come out, it is probably the second valve. You can run a similar test on the second valve if the first valve proves to be okay. 4. If you are comfortable with your do-it-yourself skills, you can also use a voltmeter to confirm that the valve is receiving 110 volts when the water dispenser is depressed. I even went so far as to jumper the water dispenser connector to the ice maker side of the valve to confirm that that side would open when I depressed the water dispenser. Be careful if you try these because you are working with 110 volt power. If the valve is not getting 110v power when the dispenser is depressed, it is probably due to either a bad controller board or a bad electrical connection.",

I LOVE the \"H\" setting - brings water to a boil very rapidly. My one suggestion - get the 5 burner if your counter will in any way accommodate it. When we got our induction cook top, I'd never even seen one or knew anyone who had used it. My husband said, \"Get the 5 burner\" - I didn't want to, as I'd never been short on burners when cooking, even for groups. (I was always running out of oven space so we did get a double oven - reg. sized - LOVE it!) Well, even the sales person didn't explain to me the advantages of the 5 burner; it's more than just a burner. With induction, it is more important to match an sizes, but . .more importantly, you can only use \"H\" (the energy boost for rapid heating\" on one burner at a time in a section. On the 4-burner cooktop, there are 2 \"sections\" (I am sure there is a technical term for it) - on the 5 burner, there are 3 sections - so . . you can put more burners on \"H\" at the same time, and yep - I needed to one day when cooking for a crowd. Of course, you make do with what you have - but I sure wish I'd gone w/the 5 burner for the times I need it. And . . I LOVE the \"L\" (lowest) setting - holds things perfectly, and I no longer need to melt choc. over a double boiler. I just put it in the pan on the stove -L setting. And .. I while many pans will work w/induction, I'd recommend the best you can afford. We have been very frugal our entire lives - and did buy Demeyere pots and pans. LOVE them - (even when I had to cook on a coil hot plate while the kitchen was being remodeled.) Worth every penny - and if you get them at Sur LaTable and don't care for them you can return them.

You would also need to poor it deep enough that it wont chip off or crack. The design would be the easy part of it all and after just completing my project and where you are wanting to do this I would suggest turning this and using it as more of a stamp and not a deep cut. So by turning the mold on its top and using it as a stamp without a real deep cut like a path walkway you get the look of the stone and it looks great. You can really get a professional look without anywhere near the cost. I don't know how to post pictures on here or I would. I poored a large area and worked the concrete just as you would for a smooth surface then went back and stamped the area. I am staining the concrete this weekend. I hope this helps",

There is a drawback: The Main thermostast and the PCC cannot be used at the same time in tandem, so you are reading the temp either from the main or from the PCC but not both at the same time. For example if I set downstairs to be 80 and the PCC to be 79 the A/C will not turn on to keep both settings, only to keep the one that at that moment is the master (either the main unit or the PCC). If you want to keep an average setting in your house, like having multiple sensors indoor and that the AC turns on to keep this average, then there are small indoor units (no screen) that are cheap that can be used for that.",

When the wash cycle is over, place the drain house in the sink and let it drain and then refill it for the rinse cycle. Six minutes seems to get our clothes really clean. Then 3 minutes for the rinse cycle. Less time because you have less clothing in it than with a full size washer. Overfilling the machine with too many clothes makes agitation (movement of machine to clean) impossible. Overfilling with water will cause some water to leak out the drain hose which is hooked in an upward position during wash and rinse cycles to keep it from prematurely draining. Machine fits pretty easily on the counter next to sink. You need only a small amount of laundry soap for each wash. It does not spin dry the clothes. You will need to wring them out or buy a small spin dryer. You could also place the machine on a table or counter and put a bucket under it for when you need to drain it. You could fill it via a garden hose. It seems to work well with cold or warm water.",

        "a": "I think of my Wonderwash as a hand crank front loader. The key to the Wonderwash is to not over load it. You need head space so that the cloths can tumble while washing and rinsing. I use liquid detergent and softener together while washing, which consists of 200 rotations forward and back. I then let the cloths drain and I refill the tub for a rinse cycle. After another 200 rotations, I drain the water and put the cloths in my spin dryer, which will remove the soap, softener and dyes. I return the clothing to the Wonderwash for the final rinse of 200 rotations and then back to the spin dryer where the water comes out pretty clear and if it doesn't, then i go for another rinse. Keep in mind you can not do your laundry in bulk and for this reason, I believe, that my cloths come out cleaner, which you will notice with your colored cloths by how much dye will be removed when using the Wonderwash and a spin dryer combination for the first time. Cloths that I've had for years, when washed in my Wonderwash for the first time, released a lot of dye, which totally shocked me and made me realize that my cloths weren't really clean at all. For me, obtaining a spin dryer was the key to the whole process. You need to see the water being released from the cloths to decide if they need rinsed another time! Hope this helps. :-)",

If you cannot cut and paste the link, then go to \"www.searspartsdirect.com\" and enter your Model number in the search box, then go to the \"Top and Cabinet\" diagram, the suspension is item #10. After verifying the part, then I would go and find the best overall deal, (part + S/H + Tax). It does take a little work to get the old parts out, and the new parts in. Also in my washer, the \"new\" suspension part was a little different (well, more like improved). I'm not sure about your Kenmore Washer, but I installed a new \"improved\" wash plate in my Whirlpool, and it seems to help reduce some of the twisting of clothing (the new impeller has three tall/long and three small \"blades\" and they are all narrow, the old impeller had three large/wide raised areas). Bottom line, my washer is as good as new, no more banging and \"OL\" codes. It was well worth the effort to save the big bucks of having someone come out... I used Google to find a service manual for my washer, it had some better info on how to open the washer, there were some self-help videos on Youtube as well. Best of luck!!!",

They tell me it's impossible or would cost more to engineer than the washer is worth. I could not get any straight answers when I made the purchase if it would work on my machine, so I look at it as a $90 learning opportunity. I would recommend just buying a coin-operated washing machine. I have found Home Depot to have the best pricing available. Be careful when shopping online, I have found some \"great deals\" on coin op washer and dryers on websites like Best Buy, but when you read the fine print the machine does not come with the coin op shown in the photo.",

While everybody's idea of a load is somewhat different, and working with the pounds specified by manufacturers is not always intuitively easy, I'd say that it would be about a half load or a bit less than a normal moderately sized load for a traditional model. Before you purchase this model, however, you should read my other comments here, along with some of the other notes. This washer is a rugged little machine, which is made in America to serve principally in janitorial operations as a mop head and rag washer for a janitor's closet. As such, it can be a very cheap and rugged alternative for home use, but IT IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC WASHER, in the modern sense. It is much more akin to antique washers, as it is really just a pail with a timer controlled agitator and a drain hose. That's it. You have to fill it with water, drain it, fill it again to rinse, drain it, maybe rinse again, and all by hand, and then wring out your clothes and dry them.",

I have been told that they are all in the same range but I can not state that as an absolute . The fact that the part is about $50 to $ 100 cheaper than what anyone else is asking is a good reason to gamble on the part . If you do not alter it in any way it can still be returned for a refund if inoperable . The only thing that might be altered is the connector that plugs into it and that is in the wiring not in the part . I would suggest that you take off the bottom pan in your oven ( normally 4 screws ) and look to see if the old part matches the one in the picture .

Provides even temperatures through out the oven allowing faster cooking times. Care must be used when opening door in convection mode. Keep your body to the side of the door as wall of heat will hit you if your standing in front of it. Wait a couple seconds before reaching in as this could be quite painful from experience. I'm quite pleased with this unit and love the induction top. I find it better than cooking with gas. You will need induction cookware for it to work. Train family members to use care as the glass surface is susceptible to scratches. I use pot felt pads when placing hot stoneware on the range surface.

After it soaks for a while just close the iid to run the load through the rest of the cycle. You can't do this with a modern HE machine.

The film we use to make these can take the weight of two and a half cinder blocks EVERY square inch... and folding does not hurt it. (Still, we do ship orders of 3 or more in a large box as long as it is not Fulfilled by Amazon) But Mylar film is transparent. It looks metallic because a separate layer of aluminum has been added to the Mylar. Normal use, even filling it or moving it, will cause tiny breaks in the foil layer that you may sometimes see if you hold it to the light - but don't worry, they are not holes. This happens with all Mylarfoil films and their barrier properties are not significantly effected . I'm glad you didn't forget your best friend!

I love my machine but the fit is tight and the door being open in to our hallway can be a problem. I've learned something else the LG needs to be drained at least once every few weeks depending on use. There is an additional drain in the machine that collects the little trickle of water wrung out in the spin cycle. This drain is very difficult to use if the machine is setting on the floor.

        "a": "'Woder' is a Clearbrook LLC / Sunrise Solutions LLC's Brand Name. The Woder website address can be found easily on each filter (Woder dot biz). Woder Filters manufactured using NSF listed components and in compliance with NSF standards. The people of Woder believe a costly certification by NSF does not provide the consumer any value, rather it only serves to increase the cost of each unit. In addition, since NSF Certifications are not required (by any Governmental Agency) in order to market water filtration products, Woder chose to keep consumer costs down while maintaining high production & filtration standards. All of Woder filters either meet or exceed NSF filtration standards & protocols for each respective filter. Woder filters are EPA certified. Woder's inline water filter (Woder 5K), is EPA certified (EPA Est. No. 51160-Al01). The filter itself is made in the USA and supervised by the relevant authorities. Woder 5K removes 99.99% of contaminants, ie mercury, Chlorine, Contaminants, lead, heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, toxic TTHMs and VOCs. Powerful multi-blends of catalysts remove unwanted and unhealthy mater from your water source without leaking. It is a Class 1 Filter that removes 99.99% of Unwanted Microorganisms, Disinfectants, Disinfection Byproducts, Inorganic Chemicals, Organic Chemicals and Radionuclides. Woder Undersink Water Filter is an Antimicrobial Water Treatment Unit (Granulated carbon with an anti-microbial agent ) of Premium Quality Water Filtration That Exceeds Industry Standards of Both NSF and ANSI. As Mentioned on The Filter Itself, The Inert Ingredient Is 'Clearbrook Gen II Formula'. Being bacteriostatic or maintaining bacteriostasis is important in any filter because it keeps organisms from self forming in filters like the algae and and various parasites similar to what you find in swimming pools once chemicals diminish. The test protocols are not published. The description itself as seen on Amazon makes a summary of the reports. The formula is tested to the EPA Protocol for Microbiological Purifiers by the University of Arizona and by Spectrum Labs in accordance with the relevant ANSI/NSF Protocols. The Woder is manufactured for removal of VOCs and Heavy Metals. It is a granular form filter with integrated diffuser that keeps the water from channeling which is typical of this type filter. In addition, the formula is of the type that is used in industrial applications for removal of high volumes at larger concentrations of contaminants. Obviously...these industrial impacts are not typically found in drinking water so the capacity of the filter is extended. It provides the ultimate solution for municipal water.",

        "a": "If I were a mother again, I would have no problem buying this product for washing diapers. It has a limited capacity, but it keeps the diapers out of the regular household laundry. For busy people it may be impractical beyond infant and early toddler size diapers. But that depends on how much you mind doing several loads a week. I wouldn't mind at all. Cloth diapers are the healthiest. Babies do NOT need all the ridiculous chemicals in disposables. I say that with a little authority. I used to work in a research and development department of a baby diaper manufacturing company. Trust me. Cloth diapers are healthier than disposables. I would never let a disposable touch my baby if I didn't have to. As for the egg, you could probably get a dozen and a half newborn diapers in it. Probably eight to twelve toddler diapers. I don't think it is such a pain to hook up to a faucet that is in a second bathroom or a utility room. Otherwise it would be kind of a pain n a kitchen or only bathroom. The full wash is about thirty minutes. Wash and no rise is about fifteen. Just remember to turn the water off before removing the hose from the faucet! I wish my mom had it in the 1950's and 1960's when she had eight children and several in cloth diapers at any given time. I was an oldest daughter and often changed the cloth diapers and rinsed them in the toilet. Then put them in the bleach pail. I would have loved the ego egg. Just take the diapers out of the pail and put them in the egg. Run it and then wring them out. Throw them in the dryer or hang them up. You don't have to mix them in with regular laundry and you can dry them together, fold them and put them away.",

I have one of those atomic clock things that has an outside temperature transmitter. I just put that transmitter inside the kegerator. Mine keeps track of the temp range in the past 12 hours and resets at midnight each day. I just went down and checked mine. Now, keep in mind that I actually have mine set to keep my beer in the mid 30's. I like cold beer! Anyway, the range of mine since midnight last night has been between 31 and 38 degrees. It was precisely 33 degrees when I just checked. It holds that pretty consistently day in and day out now that I have my dial set correctly. By the way, it is a rotary dial, with \"colder and warmer\" direction. There is no temp set. So it may take you some trial and error but I think you should be able to get there pretty quickly.

If you were heating in a refrigerator with an element then it shuts off it is here you have control of the time..(it's called controlling the \"short cycle\")..after it shuts off there will be some residual heat at first then it will be absorbed or dissipate in short time...like 8-10minutes. So you set the \"lag\" time for like 15minutes, so then the controller will not check the temperature for 15min. THEN turn off if it needs to cool down more. That is the only time control in this controller. The only way to work in your case is you would need to place a 10min. timer between your controller and the pump. the problem being is you'll need a timer that re-sets after it shuts off..Not easy,but not impossible either!",

In other words, the worse your input water is, the less it will last. Still, even this is an oversimplification as different types of contaminate will effect the carbon media differently. This is all to say that this particular filter may only last 4 months if your property is using a non-municipal water source (i.e. well water). Perhaps if your use is so irregular, maybe looking into one of the more simple, standard, 10 or 20\" filter housings would be best. Big box hardware stores will usually have 10\" carbon block or GAC filters in stock and you could simply change the filter at any time. In any case I would recommend changing out the filter prior to first use after its sat for 8 months unused. Carbon block filters, even ones with anti-bacteria additives, can build up dangerous amounts of bacteria given enough time (and I think 8 months is more than enough). Carbon filters that have sat in stale water for that long should be changed out (and filter housings cleaned with bleach if applicable) prior to consuming any water from that system.",

Carefully unclip Part #11 from the rack and slide down ward until it will unclip from the rack adjuster. Mine were very brittle from age and I snapped one off. Remove second retaining clip part #12. Hard to explain how to do this, but it is not difficult. Release the middle of it, slide it upward and and it will come off. Remove the last retainer, part #9. I used a small screw driver to assist in releasing it. Next use a small screw driver to pry apart parts 8 & 10. The top part is tabbed and the bottom part snaps together so I gently pried it apart from the bottom sides (there was a small notch i could easily get into). The rack adjuster will now slide off. Do one at a time and use the other as a reference. Assembly is the reverse. Take you time - shouldn't take over 45-60 minutes. First side takes the longest, after you do one the other is easy.

This is such a comment complain (google it GE cafe and noise) that they developed a housing that goes around the motor, but I did not notice an improvement. So my advice is to get an LG or some other brand. My last frig was an LG and it was a 100 times better. Also the ice maker always gets clogged, requiring you remove the tray and fix the issue.

My apartment has my water and electric included in the rent so I purchased this washer and a spinner as well. I don't have to lug my laundry to the laundry room, hope I have enough money to wash and dry, nor do I have to worry about any of my clothes being stolen. The only small flaw that I have found this to have is that if you have thick plush towels the size of beach towels, it will not work correctly as the weight of the towel is too heavy for this, even if you just wash one at a time. I only have two such towels that I use when I go to the pool and all my other towels are the standard size and those I can wash two at a time. when it is time to wash my comforters which right now I am not using until winter time I will have to go to the laundry mat to wash those. But back to the plush towels, I just wash those by had in the kitchen sink and rinse them then I put them in the spinner and they will come out almost dry. I have gotten my monies worth on this product as I wash every week and I even wash my queen size bed sheets, flat and fitted in this washer, one at a time, of course of it beats them getting stolen from the washer in the laundry mat and having to buy new ones! I have also bought a grey colored hose from home depot to use to fill the washer faster with water because the hose it comes with is too small and it takes forever. I have only spent $6.00 for the hose and I have used both powder and also liquid detergent in this washer. If you like powder, fill washer first then add the powder and stir so the powder can dissolve, then add the close. It's just a little extra work but I would do it than spend $10 a week and having to sit there and wait for the clothes to wash, this way while I wash, I can do other house work or watch tv because once I don't hear the timer anymore then I know it stopped. I hope this helps! :) One more thing, if you can find a small table to sit it on, I have a small table that is lower than the sink but so this way when it's time to let the water out I just unhook the attached hose into the tub and let it drain. I don't even squeeze the excess water out of the clothes because you don't have to use more than a tablespoon of detergent. I just put clean water and set the timer to 15 minutes and let it rinse, then I let the water out again, take the clothes out and put it in the spinner and set that timer to two minutes and my clothes is clean and almost dry. I hang them to dry on hangers on this clothes rack and 30 minutes later, my clothes is dry. The thickness of the clothes depends on the time.

        "a": "I have owned this machine for a few months now, and consider it a great purchase. I will answer your question, though ... by explaining how I use it because I have gone through quite a bit of trial and error, and now set it up in the best way that works for me. First I get the lid to a large plastic tote bins that I have. ( Something you can find at probably every dollar store, Walmart etc ) and lay it TOP DOWN in my bathtub. This prevents the water from submerging the bottom of the machine in any way. Then, I fill the washer side ( making sure the dial is set on WASH first ) using the hand held shower head I have. It works just fine. I don't need to use any fancy hoses, levers, etc. I know a lot of people out there do that. This works best for me. As for soap, I either dilute a laundry pod ( as I have a bunch of them anyway ) in SIX CUPS of water ( you will have TONS left over ) and use 1 TEASPOON of that, per load .. or one teaspoon of regular liquid laundry soap. I usually turn on the machine about half a second just to see suds in the water.. I don't think it's needed though. Now, this is what I do per clothing item per load: ( for two people living in my home ) - NO MORE then 5-6 tops - NO MORE then 3-4 pants ( depending on their thickness. Jeans, two per load ) - Under clothing items, I always have a lot and I always throw them all in, but be prepared to untangle socks .. so if you do not want to do that,do your socks in small loads orput them into a THICKKKKKKKKKKKK laundry bag. ( I say thick because this machine will tear the regular small ones to absolute shreds ) - Bedding, yep, bedding ... I do the cover sheet AND the top sheet together. If you want, it can handle two pillow cases along with. I don't do that, I wash the pillow cases ( cuz there is four total ) with my tops. Works fine. - Do not, do not, do NOT wash ANY blankets in this machine other then baby blankets. - Towels .. now we have standard, large towels and I will NEVER again put more then two in at a time. As well, I will NEVER put more then 3/4th a teaspoon of laundry soap in with the towels because they REALLY REALLY suds up the machine. It doesn't matter how may times you rinse, it causes tons of suds. You will be rinsing for hours, or have to take the towels out and rinse by hand. I do all wash clothes, dish towels, hand towels together. ( Usually 7-9 pieces total ) The times I have found that work best per clothing item per load: (Seriously, screw what the numbers say or what the booklet suggests ) Tops - 5-7 minutes if you have heavily soiled tops, I don't see an issue with going as much as 9 minutes. Also, if they are delitcate tops, lace, etc .. 3-4 works fine. Pants - 7-10 minutes. Heavily soiled, 10 might still be enough, but go ahead and add more if they are like muddy, etc. ( In which case, you don't wannal oad the machine up too much with mud etc) Under clothing - I run em the full 15 minutes. Works great. Towels, 13-15. After washing is done, drain. Then refill to rinse. You have to do this or your clothes are gonna be sudsy. Go ahead and leave clothing in machine while your draining and refilling. Then, run the rinse for HALF the amount of time you just washed. Then drain the machine again, take cloths out of the wash and put into the spinner. Now, for every load, you wanna SPLIT it in half to spit. For example, if you just washed four pairs of thin pants, put two in at a time. ( The spin side is smaller anyway ) Five shirts, two first, then three next. Towels ONE AT A TIME. The hand towels and etc, I spin all at once , or split in two loads, it works fine. Then hang up or throw in dryer if you have one. Now it was dead of summer where I live when I got this and its cooled now to 80s ... our clothes take the entire day to dry, unless you got a fan blowing on it. I have hung laundry on hangers for more then ten years, so this does not bother me. I know I have said lots here but I truly love this machine. It has saved money at the laundrymat and saves energy... however, be prepared to be messing with your machine quite awhile on laundry day unless you use it for washing odds and ends. Also, I would STRONGLY advise NOT using any liquid fabric softner. I am very sensitive to the stuff personally, but can tell ya, this machine doesn't really get it out real well. Good luck!",

Very easy to replace. Have your shop vac handy you will be amazed at how much lint build up there is. Also make sure your exhaust duct is clean too. I believe my heater element failed because of the lint backed up in the exhaust duct. I don't believe the lint catcher is as effective as it could be so the dryer is on my yearly schedule now to clean the lint out of the exhaust duct and to open the front bottom panel and clean out the unit.

That could mean that components are made elsewhere and assembled here, but again, they are SUPPOSED to state if they are assembled in USA using imported parts.

        "a": "The hood includes the exhaust mechanism, filter and light fixture, and once you install it (under a cabinet or all of the way to the ceiling) you must purchase the necessary exhaust pipe to either take the exhaust straight thru the roof, or get a 90 degree elbow (and the necessary pipe) to bend it (in the attic) in order to take the exhaust to the (side) eve of the house. Exhausting to the eve of the house is more economical and reduces the cost/risk of cutting thru the roof and the potential water leak etc. The elbow and aluminum exhaust pipes that I purchased at Home Depot (very economical) do not have to be sealed since they fit into one another tightly. One thing that I noticed on my hood is that the light switch occasionally stick when I try to turn the light on. Although I have not done it, I am sure that a bit of WD40 sprayed on the side of the switch would do the job. Considering the cost of this product, it is an excellent value. The unit is very easy to install. We are retired and we would buy this item again. We have stainless steel appliances and this hood matches seamless. To impress family and friends there are other hoods that would do the job at higher costs. I suggest that you follow the installation instructions as far as the distance of the hood from the top of the stove. Too close to the top of the stove will impede your working room, too far from the top of the stove, will diminish its power to exhaust the heat properly. It was suggested to us, and we followed, to install the hood where the very bottom of the hood is in line with your eye brows. It works fine, as exhausting the heat/smoke and it gives us plenty of working room with the pots etc. I hope this info helps.....",

Those dishwasher tablets work best for these small washers. The tabs contain a small oamount of Rinse aid. Whenever I fill the built-in reservoir with Rinse Aid mine too oozes out.

It fit perfectly and even came with an identical triangular filter status indicator like the W10335147A that SEARS sells postpaid for $12.50 each. It appears that Whirpool now builds refrigerators for Frigidare, Kenmore and Kitchenade as well, and probably has different part numbers on this filter for each brand! I am now looking for a sheet of the filter material containing the activated carbon. If I can find it it should be an easy matter to cut the filter material with a paper cutter and then fan fold it. The white plastic case can be easily taken apart and washed, the new fanfolded filter inserted, and then the rebuilt filter easily installed for a cost of $0.25 a change or less. Off course one would not have a valid indicator gauge, but adding a reminder to change filters every six months on one's smart phone could easily fix that! Finally, I would not run any of these refrigeratoirs with a filter very long. The filter has two purposes the first to keep dust and debrie from accumulating on the internal condensing coils and secondly to eliminate refigerator oders using the activated charcoal. These new refrigerators have a closed system so that one no longer have to brush and vacuum these coils. This especially nice for us as our siamese cat's favorite spot is just to the left of our refrigerator.",

The cubes are more like hardened slush than regular ice cubes and do not last very long in a room temperature or even chilled liquid. The other end is rounded as are the sides except for the opening side which is flat. The holding basket for cubes made is directly over the water level compartment so the cubes are very watery and start to melt if not removed immediately. The basket in the water holding compartment directly under the door lid on top of the unit is not cooled except by the cubes that are made and put into the basket by the device. Taking the cubes out of the device and putting them in our freezer as they are made is a small task, but once in the freezer each individual cube freezes solid and to each other also due to their watery condition so you have to use a tool or pick to separate them from each other and any others that were already in the ice cube container in the freezer. I did not find any other brand that was very much better except very large devices used mostly by dinning places.

The washers wash system determines water usage not the 03 machine. They both use the same science and apply the same 03 methodology. Also, with wash it, there is a knob that you \"tune\" to ionize the water which is a great application in that based on water conditions the ability to tune the machine to the proper ionization level will ensure your machine properly ionizes the water to get your clothes clean.

So I typically wash one of them & add a bunch of other small stuff. Not for washing pillows or blankets - though you could toss a throw in. It does a good job, but the thing I hate most about it is if you keep it somewhere when not in use & then wheel it to a sink to hook up to water, the wheeling isn't the most smooth in the world. This is primarily related to the leveling knob on the side, which can pop out of the frame a lot. So if your load is imbalanced with a bigger item (if ya can fit it), that helps level it, but then is a pain in the neck.

        "a": "Hi Susan. After reading the other responses, I have to say that I do NOT agree with them. I have had this machine since May 2013. I have NEVER had any issues with it. I do 5 to 8 loads of laundry every weekend. Never had a breakdown, never had clothes 'get holes in them', never had clothes 'disappear'. I use the Regular Light, Casual Light, and Delicate cycles mostly. Handles a large loads like towels (8 large) just fine on the 'super' water setting on the Normal Light cycle. Same goes for large loads of jeans (8 pairs) Takes just under an hour for the light cycles to finish, and less with the Delicate. The loads get cleaned well. The lid does lock, but only after the washer has finished filling and the cycle begins. Lid locks are now standard on ALL new washing machines per Federal safety law. I follow the manufacturers instructions and use the washer as it was intended using common sense that dictates to NEVER overload a clothes washer as to not cause undo stress on the machine or your laundry. Another thing to know is that this washer has a standard agitator in the middle of the basket. There is a similar model to this one that is a High Efficiency machine that does not have an agitator and that machine gets a lot of bad reviews as well. I have found that some comments for this machine are really pertaining to that other machine. To be fair, I have owned the washer for under a year, and there have been some comments that this machine starts having problems after a year's time. So I'll just have to see about that and cross that bridge IF I get to it. On a side note, I have the matching 7.0 Gas Dryer and it is a VERY GOOD dryer. Simple to use and dries our laundry effectively. I hope this answer helps you. Thank you",

In this particular instance this one is re-branded and being sold with a 220 micron pouch for use as an extraction machine to make \"bubble hash\" out of marijuana. You can of course use it safely to wash your baby clothes. However, I would recommend the Panda or Basecamp washing machines over this model. This one has been marked up in price for no real reason, and the mesh bag will be of no use to you. It is not tough enough for clothing use. The Panda and basecamp machines are less expensive, and better models when it comes to reliability and motor power for clothes. This model is only about $30 USD in China! (Talk about killer profit here!) Anyway, I hope this helps you! Oh and on another note, none of these machines have a spin dry function. You will want to pick up the small blue spinner (1,600 ROM)for lighter things like the baby clothes, or the bigger 3,200 RPM for when you need things almost completely dry out of the spinner, or larger things spun.

I can wash a load of undies, or a couple shirts and slacks or a queen sheet in the tub without even filling it clear up. I would think if you use a laundry sink, which might be bigger, you would just keep the water more shallow. You can tell when you have the water high enough to plunge the clothes around easily. In fact, I was just reading the newer reviews here and I like the idea of putting a laundry basket inside the washing tub so you can lift out the clothes to empty the water. You could certainly do that inside a laundry tub! Also, I just did a couple loads yesterday and am still enjoying the mobile washer - short handle and all.

I have also heard of using a hair iron, which should work as long as it gets hot enough. The recommended sealing temperature is 400 degrees. They sell impulse sealers that work well but are not really worth it unless you plan on sealing a lot of bags. We usually recommend you rotate your food supply every year or two by actually using it. However, when properly sealed, low moisture food like you are storing can stay fresh indefinitely as it is protected from oxidation, bugs, light, mold, and oxygen dependent organisms. If you plan on extended storage, be sure to use quality American Mylar as small holes in the foil layer can let oxygen in whether the bag has been punctured or not, no matter how thick the entire laminate material is.

There's some inefficiency in the induction mechanism, but I'd guess this is less than the inefficiency of heating the air and whatnot around a conventional electric element. (3) I wouldn't worry about your electric bill. It's not going to be noticeably different than conventional electric, and, even if you are blazing away at 6000 watts (4 burners going full) you are looking at less than $1/hour at the worst of USA electric rates.

I was able to position the top rack so that beers up to long neck bottles (e.g., Coronas) fit just fine with about an additional 3/4\" height clearance, then the middle rack positioned below with enough space for the small (10 oz.) size of canned sodas, then plenty of height on the bottom floor of the unit to again easily load tall neck beer bottles. Note that the bottom floor section of the fridge stays approximately 7 degrees warmer than the upper two shelves, so I use the bottom shelf mostly for bottled waters and overflow beers from the top shelf (drink from the top shelf, quick restock from the bottom shelf to the top).

Garlock (San Francisco, CA) - See all my reviews (REAL NAME) Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: Haier HLP140E 2-3/5-Cubic-Foot Compact Tumble Vented Dryer (Kitchen) I've had a great experience with this dryer and the washer that pairs with it. I live in a tiny studio apartment in Manhattan. The only problem is the wool filter in the back eventually becomes way too dirty to be useful. Even using the lint wand, it eventually just gets too chewed up. After a good deal of digging I found that you can replace the filter. If you Google the part number it is called a \"Panel Top WD510023\". They were about seven dollars with shipping. Other then that, it's a great dryer! \" I'm going to go and look up the part.",

        "a": "Unfortunately, I think I do know the source of your problem. In August last year I purchased three filters from a vendor on Amazon. When I received them I noticed a few aspects that were different. The caps were red not blue; the filters were shrink wrapped rather than the usual cardboard container and; there were product information sheets enclosed. I contacted the vendor and he offered to accept the filters in return and refund the purchase. Since he seemed willing to stand behind his product, I kept the filters. About 5 weeks later I needed to replace the filter. When I installed the new one and tried to flush water through it I discovered the same phenomenon that you describing: I believe what both you and I saw is activated charcoal which being released. I would return the filter immediately. I was impressed with the integrity of the vendor that sold me the defective filters (I think the company name was something like Tune to Music). I emailed them immediately after installing the defective filter. He responded immediately by crediting my charge card and saying I did not need to return the filters. He explained that they were purchased from a supplier that for other reasons he was no longer affiliated with. I assumed that he got burned with defective merchandise from that vendor but made good on our transaction! In the past these filters had been in stock at Amazon and I never had a problem with them. When I replaced the defective filters, I again ordered from Amazon and the vendor actually filling the order was AtoZSales. The filters were LG OEM and exactly what I expected!",

If that (plastic) shaft is longer than about 3/4\", it probably won't work. I have a Chambers cook top with phenolic dial shafts that are 1-1/4\" long.

I liked this for the first 2 months; the sound was noticeable but sounded like 'white noise', which didn't bother me. I followed the regular cleaning suggested by the manufacturer and thought all was good... until I noticed orange/pink mold forming in all the crevices I couldn't reach. I tried to take it apart (without disassembling the motor area, obviously) but there were still so many areas with the tint of color. I continued to use it and within about a week from this point, there was black mold spotted everywhere inside. I looked up how to clean it online and I came across the Amazon reviews. I noticed many people saying that this left a white film in the room and it finally clicked: Our wood furniture, baseboards and fan blades had been needing a lot of extra cleaning that I didn't think much about beforehand... but it's only in the room w/ the humidifier! I'll second all of the reviews on here expressing their opinions about how bad the white film and mold is with this product. The company wouldn't even let me return it without paying over $20 in shipping and they couldn't guarantee a refund/replacement.",

I put the wet clothes into the tub and wring them, putting them into another basket. The wet clothes gives the weight to secure the tub and as I wring them then the water that is squeezed out and falls back into the tub gives me the weight I need to balance out the weight of the wringer on the tub.

After a year or two, especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink, the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel, which will then also start to corrode, until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere (could be somewhere very small), signaling the end of the machine's service life. The plate is not meant to be repaired, only replaced along with the rest of the unit. That water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard, and should be dealt with immediately (by removing the damaged unit).

I love how it look but installing it was a b*tch. It took a total of about 13 to 14 hours in a whole day for me to install mostly by myself. My wife did help me load it up into the packaging box that it came in. We use the box on top of the stove to support this range to help ease the load of loading it under our cabinet. This sucker weight like 40 to 50 pounds. Some of the nut and bolt that came with the package doesn't feel secure for me. I don't wanted the whole range drop down. I end up using toggle bolt that can handle 80+ lbs. each and use them on the top of the cabinet and use heavy duty dry wall anchor and screws that support 30+ lbs. for the side. This thing wasn't going anyway. For the perfect next time I think I well drill hole that was 1/4\" bigger for running the power cord thru it. I end being slight not level on the range due to the cord bushing of the power cord on fitting the hole so it bumped 2cm higher and not set flat on it. Mounting the four top screw was a pain. Even with toggle bolt I have to end reverse mount it to make it easier to screw nut into the toggle bolt.",

        "a": "In a word, yes. But if you're interested in the why/how, one may consider this: standard kitchen and bathroom faucets have a device located where the water exits, called an \"aerator\", which is usually comprised of a piece of steel screen, and a couple of metal or plastic components inside. This little gadget screws into the end of the faucet, precisely where you installed the adapter for the dishwasher. The purpose of this device is to intermix the exiting water with lots of air in order to increase the volume of the liquid by generating lots of little bubbles. This is why the water coming out of most faucets appears to be white and bubbly, instead of a steady, clear, stream like you would expect to see from the end of your garden hose. A faucet with an aerator produces a more controlled and gentle stream, and because the device mixes in lots of air, less water is needed in order to produce a steady and useful flow. In other words, aerators have the cumulative effect of drastically reducing both the volume of water and the exit speed of the water at the faucet. If you have noticed a difference in water pressure after installing the adapter for this dishwasher, I would venture to guess that you had one of these devices installed (99.9% of faucets do have one) and that you removed it in order to install the dishwasher adapter. So in summation, the good news is that if all my assumptions about your circumstance so far are correct, what you're experiencing is normal. The bad news (if it can be called bad?) is that you have to put up with a slightly more powerful, less ruley, stream of water coming out of your faucet. In that sense, it does represent a trade-off of sorts, however, it should also be pointed out that many people remove the aerators from the kitchen faucet on purpose, for the express purpose of achieving the higher pressure and flow that you're experiencing. Attempting to install the dishwasher adapter to the end of the aerator will not work because the dishwasher adapter will prevent any air from being drawn in to the aerator. If your faucet pressure is so high that it is a problem to use, the best advice would be to adjust the valves under your sink until you attain a more desirable rate of flow. I hope this helps!",

There should be a sticker along the side saying model number and serial number. Google the model number, door handle. You will find a list of sites that sell OEM parts, and it will tell you the part number. If the part numbers match then yes this will work. That's what I did and had it fixed in minutes after getting it. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask, as from ordering receiving and replacing I had mine up and running in two days.",

One large input port and a single smaller output port will probably work with a lot of the modern washing machines, but this one was made to fit the bracket on the Whirlpool. Since Whirlpool makes Kenmore washers, it may well fit. Check your old pump for a part #.",

Since all the lint gathers on the screen and then drops into the drawer below, this is what you need to be able to detach, not the whole unit. Although you did not ask, this is a wonderful product well worth the small investment. My previous dryer has a self-contained lint system, but my new one needed to be vented outside. I was afraid of animals getting in the venting, so I went to this model instead of outdoor venting. It has worked perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone.",
